1.3 release
===========

Diagram labels:
- Added a dependency for the libary textalloc
- Added a label feature to plots, which can be used to find points of interest.


Fixities:
Working with a list of fixities is a little awkward.
For a nice user experience I've added a object that abstracts away the list of fixity.
You can now use "FixityTypes2D" to create fixities in 2D.
- Added a fixity object that can be used in place of using lists.
- Added the FixityTypes2D object, which can be used to make new fixities objects for 2D beams.

Diagram:
In prior versions, diagrams were set up so if there were postivie and negative loads, they would go on the same side of a plot.
Now diagrams are set up to.
