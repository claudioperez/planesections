Diagram
=======

The diagram module is used to plot representations of the beam.
These output plots will include labels, loads, and support fixities.
While the beam can analyze all support types, currently not all support types can be plotted.
Only free, roller, pin, and fixed supports can be plotted.
Similarly, the diagram only supports the plotting of vertical point loads, distributed loads, and moments.

It's recommended that the diagram features are accessed throught the beam plotter
